Lead Score Case Study

Problem Statement:

X Education, an online course provider for industry professionals, faces challenges in lead conversion. Despite acquiring numerous leads daily, the conversion rate remains low at 30%. The company aims to improve efficiency by identifying potential leads, referred to as 'Hot Leads,' to increase the conversion rate to approximately 80%.

Leads are generated through website visits, form submissions, video views, and referrals. The sales team engages in communication with leads, aiming to convert them into paying customers. The current process lacks focus, leading to inefficient resource utilization. X Education seeks a model that assigns a lead score between 0 and 100 to prioritize leads, enabling the sales team to concentrate on high-potential prospects.

Goals of the Case Study:

Build a logistic regression model to assign lead scores based on the likelihood of conversion.
Lead scores should range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a greater likelihood of conversion.
Improve the lead conversion rate to approximately 80%.
Address potential future challenges by creating a model that can adapt to changes in company requirements.
Key Steps:

Data Collection:
Gather data on website interactions, form submissions, video views, and referral sources.
Include information on successful conversions and unsuccessful leads.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze the dataset to identify patterns and correlations.
Understand the characteristics of successful conversions.

Feature Engineering:
Identify relevant features affecting lead conversion.
Create new features if needed to enhance model performance.

Model Building:
Use logistic regression to build a predictive model.
Train the model on historical data, considering successful and unsuccessful leads.

Lead Scoring:
Implement a scoring system ranging from 0 to 100 based on the logistic regression model's predictions.
Higher scores indicate a higher probability of conversion.

Validation and Optimization:
Validate the model using a separate dataset to ensure generalization.
Optimize the model based on validation results.

Documentation:
Prepare documentation on the model's architecture, variables, and scoring system.
Address potential future challenges and provide recommendations for adjustments.

Presentation:
Create a comprehensive presentation (PPT) summarizing the case study.
Include model insights, recommendations, and the ability to adapt to future changes.

Conclusion:
The logistic regression model aims to transform X Education's lead management process, prioritizing efforts on leads with higher conversion potential. By achieving an 80% conversion rate, X Education can optimize resources, enhance customer acquisition, and adapt to evolving market dynamics.
